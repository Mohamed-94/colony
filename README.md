## Introduction to Emergence , Chaos theory and NonLinear Dynamics

Emergence is part of Chaos theory which is a part of Dynamics the branch of mathematics that deals with non-linear systems in our universe aka chaotic systems that the prediction of their future status is impossible due to the huge shifts made by the slightly changes of their initial conditions.

Emergence on the other hand is when the parts of a system not equal the the whole system meaning when a group creatures perform a task that can not be performed by one of their  elements.

examples include:  (Ant colony, Human society or the universal economy).

## about

 Colony is a simple unity project trying to demonstrate the properties of emergence and chaos through a game with very simple set of rules and initial conditions.
 the goal is to make it as simple as possible to get clear emergence experience, 
 it creates a hurricane pattern like a few minutes after being played.

## three rules

in this game I've defined a simple rules with specific initial conditions to begin with..
the three rules is as follows :

1- gree birds follow red birds

2- red birds follow yellow birds

3- yellow birds follow green birds

so simple huh..

## how it works

 the game is developed using unity v.2019  
 there are ten birds from each color and every color has a single script (three scripts in total)
 every bird has a box collider and can fly from right to left and go backwards,
 upon every interaction between birds (the colliders) the above rules get applied.
 
 after a few minutes some random bird will take over the all other birds start following him.

## wierd results

although the rules and the initial conditions are very simple and easy managed, you will get a different result each time you play the game even though the initial conditions aren't changed! teh.
